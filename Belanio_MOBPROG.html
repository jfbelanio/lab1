<p style="color: #FA8072; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Hi! I'm Hazzel Belanio with an 18 years of existence in this world and I live in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City. 
Actually, I'm feeling blessed right now! In fact, I wan't to treat you a cup of coffee.
Do you like watching movies? Because I do! Let's watch some other time. I'll treat you. 
I also super love Samgyeopsal (korean barbeque), basically Eating! You can see me around the campus, just eating.
You wanna know what my heart is feeling right now? Well, she's happy and contented with what she have. 
I'm currently learning my self-worth, since before I know nothing about it. I learned 
that knowing your self-worth is really important, 
because that's the time you'll know how people should treat you and how you deserve to be treated.<strong></p>
